## helpdesk
This application is a IT issue ticket system for a small company and group. It is build with MEAN ( MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) technology and running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) cloud server. I developed it to learn Angular.js and could understand Angular key technologies such as Controller, Router, Service, Filter and Directive.
